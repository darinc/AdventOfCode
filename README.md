# AdventOfCode

[adventofcode.com](http://adventofcode.com) solutions written in several different languages.

I have written code in 11 different languages.  Six of which I've used recently enough to be productive in.  There are hundreds of languages out there and several that I've been wanting to out.  I'm using the advent of code programming challenge as a format to get myself to try some new languages.

My goal is to program solutions for the challenges in at least 25 different programming languages.

### Current status 2015:

* Day 6
* 13 solutions
* 9/25 unique languages

### Current status 2016:

* Day 9
* stats coming soon

### Current status 2017:

* Day 6
* stats coming soon

### My solutions are:

* probably pretty wonky in languages I don't know
* often "just enough" to work
* not trying for code golf or cleverness
* maybe not the best to learn from

### I picked the languages I picked:

* because I felt like it
* for the hell of it
* I'm not exactly sure why

### Languages used
* √ CoffeeScript
* √ Python
* √ Go
* √ Perl
* √ PHP
* √ SQL
* √ Rust
* √ Swift
* √ Lua
